Homework 3

After you have tested some classifiers/regressors on the wines dataset (homework 1), 
you need to improve your models.
 Your tasks for this homework are: 
•Use gridsearch with cross validation to improve one of your previously submitted models (Homework 1)
 for each problem: regression, binary classification and multiclass classification.
 Select your parameters and scan their possible values properly (hint: use numpy). 
Report the test set score, best parameters,
 best cross-validation score and best estimator. 
What is the improvement with respect to the past results?
 •For your binary classification problem, use gridsearch and cross-validation with SVC. 
What is the best kernel? Print the heat map of mean cross-validation score (hint: use the mglearn library), 
the ROC curve and report the AUC value.
 •For your binary classification model, 
repeat the gridsearch with cross validation step using AUC as the evaluation metric. 
Do the result improves? Elaborate.
